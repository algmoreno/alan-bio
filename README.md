Alan Moreno Bio Page 

On this page I include "About Me", "My Work" and "Reach Out" sections
that tell you a little about myself, projects I have completed and how you
can contact me in the future. At the top of the page, you may click on any of 
those options in the navigation bar. 

There are three projects you can choose to see and if you click on them, 
it will take you to the sites themselves. In the contact section, I have 
stated my phone number, email and Linkedin account, which are all great ways to reach me. 

Webpage is formatted to be viewed across many different consoles.
